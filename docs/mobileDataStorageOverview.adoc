= Data Storage Summary

|===
| Do's | Dont's
| *Classify data storage according to sensitivity and apply controls accordingly* _(To understand what information should be protected)_
| *Store any sensitive data on a mobile device where possible* _(Prevent data leak)_.

| *When storing sensitive data on the device, use a file encryption API provided by the OS or other trusted source* _(Secure Cryptography)_ 
| *Write data to persistent memory accessible to other applications without encryption* _(Shared storage is untrusted)_ 

| *Use file encryption APIâ€™s which use a secret key protected by the device unlock code and deletable on remote wipe if available* _(Protect secret key)_
| *Including the keys in the same attacker-readable directory as the encrypted content* _(Can be used to decrypt data)_

| *Make use of remote wipe and kill switch APIs to remove sensitive information from the device in the event of theft or loss* _(Prevent data leak if the device is lost)_
| *Take screeenshots contain sensitive data* _(Avoid sensitive data is exposed through screenshots)_ 

| *Use a time based (expiry) type of control which will wipe sensitive data from the mobile device once the application has not communicated with its servers for a given period of time* _(Less chance to decrypt data by using brute force)_
| *Leak permission-protected data to other applications* _(Prevent other apps access sensitive data)_

| *Automatic application shutdown and/or lockout after X minutes of inactivity* _(Less chance of data leak)_
| *Allow third party keyboards to be used for inputs that may contain sensitive data* _(Prevent data leak)_

| *Verify that OS level storage encryption is enabled and the device is protected by a PIN or passphrase* _(Ensure data encryption by default)_
| *Backup or synchronize sensitive data* _(Prevent data leak)_

| *Restrict the data that is shared with other applications* _(Prevent other apps access sensitive data)_
| *Log sensitive information* _(Prevent data leak through logs)_

| *Nullify any variables that hold keys after use* _(Secure keys in memory)_
| *using immutable objects for sensitive keys or passwords such as in Android java.lang.String and use char array instead* _(Secure keys in memory)_

| *Restrict broadcast messages (e.g., Android Broadcast Intents) to authorized applications* _(Prevent other apps access sensitive data)_
|

| *Disable Auto Correction and Autosuggestion for inputs that contain sensitive data* _(Prevent data leak)_
| 

| *Disable cut, copy and paste functionalities for inputs that may contain sensitive data or restrict the pasteboard to be accessible only from this application* _(Prevent data leak)_
|

| *Delete application caches on app termination* _(Prevent data leak)_
|

| *Clear cookies and data in Webview on app termination* _(Prevent data leak)_
|

| *Remove sesitive data from views when in background* _(Prevent data leak)_
