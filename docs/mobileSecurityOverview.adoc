= Mobile Security Recomendations Overview

== Authentication & Session Management
|===
|Do's |Dont's

|Perform Authentication on the Server Side _(The client side should never be trusted)_.
|Use Fingerprint Scanner for Authentication _(Possible False Positives)_

|Use Randomly Generated access tokens instead of sending user credentials in requests. _(At worst, a temporary session token can therefore only be stolen)_
|Use Pattern Locks for Authentication _(Lack of Entropy, Smudge Attacks)_

|A password policy is enforced at the remote endpoint. _(Prevent easily guessable passwords from being used)_.
|Use Pin code authentication _(Easily brute forced and the end user may resuse the device security pin)_.

|Sessions are terminated at the remote endpoint after a predefined time. _(Sessions token lifetimes should be kept short to limit the attack window if an valid session token is stolen)_
|Do not use any values for authenticating a user like device identifiers or geo-location _(These can be spoofed easily)_.

|Temporarily lock out a user after a number of failed login attempts. _(Prevent an endless brute force attack)_.
|Avoid relying on any roles or permission information that comes from the mobile device itself _(The client side and user input should not be trusted)_.

|Use contextual anomaly based detection to take into account the users IP, geographic location, time of day as part of the authentication phase. _(Helps detect unusual login activity)_
|

|A second factor of authentication exists and is enforced. _(Extra layer of protection in case another authentication factor has been compromised)_
|

|Step-up authentication is used for carrying out sensitive actions in an application. _(Useful when a user's device is stolen and they have already authenticated through the app)_
|

|Allow the user to see their current login sessions and allow them to logout of other sessions via the app. _(The end user will be able to detect rogue sessions with the most accuracy instead of using anomaly detection)_
|

|Perform local integrity checks within the code to detect any unauthorized code changes before doing offline authentication _(Tampering may allow authentication bypasses)_.
