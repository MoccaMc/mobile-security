== Network Security
|===
|Do's |Dont's

|*Include a Backup Cert Pin.* _(Retain app connectivity if new keys on server are used or the CA is changed)_.
|*Pin the full certificate*. _(The full cert, and potentially backup certs are available for inspection, the certificate is bundled with the app meaning that when a cert expires the app must be rebuilt with a new cert)_.

|*Perform Certificate Pinning using the hash of the public key - SubjectPublicKeyInfo of the X.509 certificate.* _(Allows you to anonymize a certificate or public key and ensures an attacker does not see the reserved certificate or public key in advance of its use)._
|*Send sensitive data without certificate pinning.* _(Creates higher risk as an attacker with network privileges, or who has compromised TLS, is better positioned to intercept data)_.

|*Perform proper certifcate validation if the platform doesn't allow true certificate pinning.* _(Adds an extra precautionary check when sending sensitive data)_.
|*Establish connections with endpoints that offer a different certificate or key, even if signed by a trusted CA.* _(The channel is not trusted.)_

|*Use TLS for network encryption.* _(SSL 2.0 and 3.0 have been deprecated by the IETF)_.
|*Use Mixed SSL sessions*. _(The users session ID can be exposed over non HTTPS requests)_.

|*Use a secure channel consistently throughout the app*. _(Ensure that some network calls are not sent in plaintext)_.
|*Use localhost network ports for handling sensitive IPC.* _(The interface is accessible by other applications on the device)_.

|*Verify that the app doesn’t rely on a single insecure communication channel such as email or SMS for critical operations, such as enrollments and account recovery.* _(Use a hardware token or secure channel as GCM or Apple Push notifications)_.
|*Don’t rely on unauthenticated SMS data to perform sensitive commands.* _(The input may be malicious, be spoofed or sniffed using another app with SMS read permissions)_.

|*Verify that the app uses some form of whitelisting to control access to external domains.* _(Limit the outbound requests to predefined trusted domains)._
|*Avoid sending crash logs over the network in plaintext*. _(Logs can contain sensitive or important information about the user and/or the application)_.


|*Pay particular attention to validating all data received from and sent to non-trusted third party apps/plugins before incorporating their use into an application.* _(Some plugins can interact with ad networks etc)_.
|

|*Consider using HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).* _(Protect against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking)_.
|

|*Make sure that you don’t trust data downloaded from HTTP or other insecure protocols.* _(Validate the data before using it in an application)_.
|

|*Require User Approval before Executing a Function that Transmits PII over a Network*. _(Inform the user that their data is being transferred over a network or being sent to another location)_.
|

|*For highly sensitive values, implement additional encryption in transit.* _(Improved protection in case the secure channel somehow compromised)_.
